# Generating-Harry-Potter-Story-Using-RNN-and-Tensorflow
This repository contains a Ready-to-run Google Colab Notebook to generate Harry Potter Story of your own using RNNs implemented using tensorflow. Dataset is imported from Kaggle but preprocessed by me and stored in the drive. It's been imported in the code as well.
